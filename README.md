# Milestone Project 2

## Rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock - game

### __Description:__

This is a variation of the popular Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The game was invented by Sam Kass and Keren Bryl. It was popularized by the series The Big Bang Theory - especially the eighth episode of the second season: The Lizard-Spock Expansion, which is devoted to the game. Sheldon Cooper plays it with Dr. Koothrappali, constantly tying for Spock's figure. The game or its rules also appear in episode 20 of this season, and in episode 17 of season five.

### __Features:__

- A clearly visible, simple and readable game title.
- A scoreboard that constantly monitors the course of the game.
- Pictures showing all available weapons. When you hover over one of them, the mouse cursor will change, letting the player know that they are clickable.
- After clicking, the image will enlarge, making it easier for the player to remember his last choice.
- The game starts when you click/select one of the five weapons, then information will be displayed about what the player and the computer chose.
- The game starts when you click/select one of the five weapons, after which the game restart button will be displayed at the bottom of the page.
- When we start our game, the large inscription "Choose your weapon" will change to information about whether we won, lost or drew the round.
